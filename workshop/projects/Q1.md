# Mini project #1

Hi!
We've already reviewd the repo together. So you should be familiar with the code structure.
Please, perform the following tasks (ideally, each person does 1 task):

First, someone should _fork_ the repo and make a branch called `Q1-dev`. Add all the team members to your forked repo. Everyone clone the forked repo, checkout to `Q1-dev` and perform one of the following tasks:

- Review the the code in [`/paper/fig2.ipynb`](../paper/fig2.ipynb) and ensure it is compliant to PEP8 guidelines.
- In `paper/fig2.ipynb`, certain variables are added to the namespace via `%run` magic command from the `_dataset-selection.ipynb` notebook. This is prone to errors as the exact variables being imported are not explicit. Resolve this issue following best practices.
