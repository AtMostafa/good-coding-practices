# Mini project #5

Hi!

We've already reviewd the repo together. So you should be familiar with the code structure.
Please, perform the following tasks (ideally, each person does 1 task):

First, someone should _fork_ the repo and make a branch called `Q5-dev`. Add all the team members to your forked repo as collaborators. Everyone clone the forked repo, checkout to `Q5-dev` and perform one of the following tasks:

1. In [`defs.py`](/monkey/defs.py), data files that will be used in the repo as example sessions have been hardcoded in the `raster_example` variable. There is no guarantee that those files exist.  
Following the PEP8 guidelines and the structure of the repo, incorporate a function in the [`dataTools.py`](/tools/dataTools.py) that searches all the files, directories and subdirectories of `params.root` for the example sessions in `raster_example` and raise an error with a helpful message in case it fails.
1. In [`defs.py`](/monkey/defs.py), certain variables and functions are defined that will be used across the project to ensure processing parameters are identical throughout. Refactor the code and ensure compliance to PEP8. In particular, [`prep_general(df)`](/monkey/defs.py#L36) pre-processes every data file and is critical. Add sufficient comments, docstring, type annotations, etc to ensure it remains easy to maintain.
1. Data files are loaded using the [`load_pyal_data()`](/tools/dataTools.py#L41) function. This function loads data files of the `*.p` or `*.mat` format and returns a `pd.DataFrame`. It also converts `*.mat` files to `*.p` files for faster operations in the future.  
Move this function to the [`params.py`](/params.py) file. Ensure every reference to this function throughout the repo remains functional, by changing how it is imported in various files.
1. The function [`canoncorr()`](/tools/ccaTools.py#L315) implements a technique called the Canonical Correlation Analysis, or CCA. This function has been ported from its [MATLAB implementation](https://uk.mathworks.com/help/stats/canoncorr.html). However, the popular python package, `scikit-learn` also has an implementation of CCA. Replace the code _within_ the function [`canoncorr()`](/tools/ccaTools.py#L315) with the `scikit-learn` function, without changing any other code, such that the function input/outputs remain identical from the outside.
1. 

In the end, everyone should commit their development to the `Q5-dev` branch, ensuring their work can be merged. Then, submit a Pull Request (PR) to merge your changes to the `main` branch of the original repo ([https://github.com/AtMostafa/good-coding-practices/](https://github.com/AtMostafa/good-coding-practices/)). We might review your PR together in the wokshop.

Best of luck and don't hesitate to ask if you have any questions.
