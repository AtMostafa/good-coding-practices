# Mini group projects for the workshop

Below is a list of mini projects for groups of 4-5 participants. They don't entail much coding, rather practicing the ideas we reviewed in the workshop.

## Clone this repo

First, go to this repo: [**https://github.com/AtMostafa/good-coding-practices**](https://github.com/AtMostafa/good-coding-practices)  
Clone it using the **HTTPS** link.
If you have set up SSH keys in your laptop and in your GitHub account, use the SSH link.

## Set up the `conda` environment

We will run everything inside a conda python environment.
The environment file ([`env.yml`](/env.yml)) contains the name and contents of this python environment.  
Open a terminal where you've cloned the repo and create the environment by: `conda env create -f env.yml`.  
The environment for this repo is called `workshop`.  
Activate the environment by: `conda activate workshop`.  
You can also add/remove dependencies to/from the `env.yml` file and *update* your existing environment.
Open a terminal where the repo (and the `env.yml` file) are located and try: `conda update -f env.yml`.

## Download the data files

Everyone needs to download the two data files from [here](https://osf.io/wnv3e/files/osfstorage) (both files are required).
