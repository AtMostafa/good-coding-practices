# Mini group projects for the workshop

Below is a list of mini projects for groups of 4-5 participants. They don't entail much coding, rather practicing the ideas we reviewed in the workshop.

First, go to this repo: [**https://github.com/AtMostafa/good-coding-practices**](https://github.com/AtMostafa/good-coding-practices)  
Clone it using the **HTTPS** link, unless you have set up SSH keys in your laptop and in your GitHub account.

ALso, everyone needs to download the data files from [here](https://osf.io/wnv3e/files/osfstorage) (both files are required).
